# docktorrent

Using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/),
[rTorrent](http://rakshasa.github.io/rtorrent/) and
[ruTorrent](https://github.com/Novik/ruTorrent) to run a full-featured
BitTorrent box.

## Highlights

  - All-in-one Docker container, build once and run everywhere.
  - Newest version of rTorrent and ruTorrent, with support of DHT and
    asynchronous DNS which will results in a more responsive rTorrent.
  - Enable all useful ruTorrent plugins by default.
  - Get a working BitTorrent box in less than 3 minutes, give it a quick try
    and tune the configs later.
  - rTorrent will automatically restarts on crash or freeze.
  - No more boring installation, also keep your OS in a clean state.

## Quick Start

Clone this repository and build the image locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kfei/docktorrent
cd docktorrent
docker build -t docktorrent .
```

The building process may take some time. You can just pull the latest image
from Docker Hub:
```bash
docker pull kfei/docktorrent
```

After the image is built or pulled, run the docktorrent container, for example:
```bash
docker run -it \
    -p 80:80 -p 45566:45566 -p 9527:9527/udp \
    --dns 8.8.8.8 \
    -v /data-store:/rtorrent \
    -e UPLOAD_RATE=1024 \
    kfei/docktorrent    # Or just `docktorrent` for locally built image
```
Note that:
  - The exposed ports are required for ruTorrent web interface, rTorrent
    listening and the DHT protocol according to the default `.rtorrent.rc`.
  - The `--dns 8.8.8.8` argument is optional but recommended. It seems like the
    current version of rTorrent still has some [DNS
    issues](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent/issues/180), using Google's
    DNS may help.
  - The `/data-store` volume is for all downloads, torrents and session data,
    just make sure the disk space is enough.
  - Override the `upload_rate` setting of rTorrent to 1024KB. Check the full list of
    available [runtime configs](#runtime-configs).

If the container starts without errors, visit `http://127.0.0.1` through any web
browser, log in to with the default username/password: `docktorrent/p@ssw0rd`.

Happy seeding!

## Runtime Configs

There are some environment variables can be supplied at run time:
  - **LOGS_OFF**: Set this to `yes` to turn off all logs generated by rTorrent
    and other services so that you don't have to worry about space for
    `/var/log`. Default is not set.
  - **AUTH_OFF**: Disable HTTP authentication on certain network. E.g.,
    `192.168.1.0/24` or `all`.

Override settings in `.rtorrent.rc`:
  - **IP** overrides `ip`.
  - **MAX_PEERS** overrides `max_peers`.
  - **MAX_PEERS_SEED** overrides `max_peers_seed`.
  - **MAX_UPLOADS** overrides `max_uploads`.
  - **DOWNLOAD_RATE** overrides `download_rate`.
  - **UPLOAD_RATE** overrides `upload_rate`.
  - **PORT_RANGE** overrides `port_range` (*6801-6810*).

## Requirement

All you need is to have Docker installed on your system. Check Docker
[Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for installation guide on
your OS platform.

## Tips

  - `docker stop` can gracefully shutdown rTorrent if you give it more time by
`docker stop -t 120` (which means 120 seconds to time out).

Bug reports and feature suggestions are both welcome. Feel free to use the
